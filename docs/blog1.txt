Hello World,

Welcome to the TrebleSET creative center, my name is Scott E. Thompson and I plan to bring you on my journey as a Web Developer and Music Teacher!
I am currently working to learn the basics of node.js and Express, while I simultaneously prepare for work as an elementary music teacher.
I'll be trying to find my balance between family time, learning, and work as I am unwilling to sacrifice any of the three. 

So I hope you enjoy my journey and it helps you along the way with your own.

God bless,

Scott E. Thompson
